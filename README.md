#Mini Hardware Project for Computational Structure course at SUTD
This project is built on the mojo fpga development board made by embedded micro. 
This was created using Lucid, Hardware Description Language (HDL).
The goal of this project is a simple experiment to test the functionalities of an FPGA, using it to control a one-bit full adder.
